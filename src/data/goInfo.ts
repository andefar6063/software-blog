  intro:
    "Golang, also known as Go, is a programming language valued for its simplicity and speed. There are two key reasons for that.",

  keyPoints: [
    "Go converts source code into machine code during compilation. This method contributes to its speed.",
    "Go features a built-in memory management that incorporates automatic memory cleanup. This allows the language to handle its use of memory, easing the development process.",
  ],
  comparison: {
    title: "Language Comparison",
    points: [
      "Other compiled languages, such as C and Rust, do not have memory management. Therefore, they are often viewed as being harder to use, but can perform better in terms of speed.",
      'Interpreted languages, like Python and JavaScript, are read line-by-line at runtime. They <em class="text-secondary">do</em> have memory management, but lack the speed of compiled languages.',
    ],
  },
  conclusion:
    "Go is a great mix of two worlds that you as a developer can make use of.",
