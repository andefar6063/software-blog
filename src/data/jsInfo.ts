  title: "Why JavaScript Is Used",
  intro:
    "JavaScript tops the list of programming languages in use. At least, that's what the Stack Overflow Survey from 2023 concluded. Why is that? I've come to realize that there isn't an exact answer to that question. Nevertheless, I've compiled a list of factors that likely contribute to its popularity.",
  keyPoints: [
    "JavaScript creates dynamic user interfaces with interactive elements. This includes things like interacting with the DOM API, and with the backend.",
    'JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. That means, as a developer, you don\'t have to understand "complex" topics like types.',
    "Last, but not least, JavaScript offers unparalleled adaptability. E.g. The language is backward compatible and has many frameworks available, such as Vue, React, Svelte, and Angular.",

      'While there are many alternatives, none of them has yet to become the <em class="text-secondary">default</em> language for web development. This, might be the number one factor for the given question.',
      "TypeScript, the fifth most popular programming language, is regarded as the best alternative to JavaScript. However, even though that might be true, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning it compiles to JavaScript.",
    ],
  },
  conclusion: "In short, JavaScript is both flexible, reliable, and versatile.",
